# SublimeText3 SwitchDictionary
It is a tiny [Sublime Text 3]() plugin, not tested on ST 2, that add commands and shortcuts to switch between: no spellcheck, spellcheck for French, and spellcheck for English.

*Note:* it will soon be better, allowing you to define your own list of dictionaries.

## Commands
### `enable_english_spellcheck`
  - It enables shellcheck, and sets the dictionary to *English*
  - [It is binded]() to the key chain <key>ctrl+k, ctrl+e</key>

### `enable_french_spellcheck`
  - It enables shellcheck, and sets the dictionary to *French*
  - [It is binded]() to the key chain <key>ctrl+k, ctrl+f</key>

### `switch_spellcheck`
  - It cycles between *English*, *French*, and *None*
  - [It is binded]() to the key chain <key>ctrl+k, ctrl+s</key> and <key>ctrl+alt+s</key>

### `disable_spellcheck`
  - It disables shellcheck
  - It is NOT binded to any key

## :boom: TODO
- Publish it !
- Find a nice way to install it locally?

## :hourglass: Future Features
- Be more general: allow users to define manually a list of dictionary (path, and name), and add one command for each dictionary, and make the switch_spellcheck command cycle between them!
